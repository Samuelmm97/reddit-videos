      '\n' +
      `Two days ago I was hanging out with my buddy and his 3 friends from where he lives. I haven't 
  met them because I live away. We played cards and talked for a bit. While we were talking one of his friends (I'll call her Ana) asked everyone what's the weirdest place they had sex, I didn't want 
  to seem like a loser (I know it's dumb) so I tried to think of something believable but couldn't think of anything, so they understood I was a virgin after a couple seconds of silence. Ada said "No 
  way YOU haven't ever had sex” and my buddy came to my rescue and told her to leave it alone so she 
  didn't push me further.\n` +
      '\n' +
      "Ana was quite lovely and I was getting kind of attracted to her. We all talked a bit more and 
  watched a movie. She was sitting next to me and the seats were lined up in kind of like a \\ _ / shape, we were sitting in the middle one. It was getting a little late and she must have been getting sleepy so she slowly snuggle-leaned on me. I am ashamed but I couldn't keep myself from imagining 
  having sex with her so I got a boner. I was hoping she wouldn't notice but I think she giggled because of it. \n" +
      '\n' +
      "When the movie ended, the other two went home. Little later I said that I'll go home too, then Ada asked if I could walk with to her place, I said sure. We arrived, exchanged numbers and I walked to a bus stop thinking I'll never talk to her again because of my shy, insecure ass. \n" +      
      '\n' +
      `While I was waiting the bus, she called me and told me she took my keys by accident, I checked them and said ok. I got excited to be able to see her again. Walked to her apartment, ringed the bell and she told me to come up. She opened the door, and she was wearing kind of a boy's shorts pajama and a baggy tshirt with no bras. I couldn't believe that this was real, but she told me to come in. I totally forgot why I got there so walked in. She gave me the keys and asked me if I wanted tea. I was really sure where this was going so I got really nervous, even thought of running out in 
  that moment. She came with teas, we talked a little bit then she asked me "Is this a weird place to have sex?" I just got fucking frozen but no action down there. She took off her shirt. I was begging to get hard and don't know why I couldn't. She came closer, looked into my eyes, grabbed my pants and took them off. I had all the time in the world to stop her then but I didn't know if I wanted to. When she saw my flaccid, 3 centimeters weiner she froze for a couple of seconds too. I got so 
  embarrassed that I just pulled my pants up and ran out, letting out a small "sorry". She said "wait!" behind me but I couldn't look behind and ran to the bus stop. We didn't call each other and I didn't tell anyone about this.\n` +

      "EDIT: Thanks y'all very much for the advices, you actually made me feel better. I think I'll call her tomorrow (It's 2.30 am here) because I'm afraid to make her feel insecure or like it's her 
  fault. I won't specifically talk about the incident but will ask her on a date. I hope all goes well!\n" +
      '\n' +
      "EDIT 2: WOW! Thanks everyone. I was really not sure but felt like calling would be more sincere than texting so I called. I felt my tummy turn when I hit the call button, but it was definitely 
  worth it. I told her that I am so sorry for the other night, and it was definitely not her fault. I said that it was just because I really liked her so got nervous, and I didn't want to fuck up a possible friendship/relationship so my head just wasn't there when I fled like that. She said that it's totally ok and she felt like going that fast wasn't the best thing for her to do either. We decided to give it another shot so we're going on a date tomorrow! No planned sex though, we both feel 
  it should happen more naturally. Thanks again <3",
