Sounds cool, isn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo like an hour ago I stumbled upon an HFO-Porn on the Frontpage of PH and since I heard of it a few times, I thought I might try it.  \nI opened the Video, got my towel, closed my eyes, listened to the sounds and gave it a go.  \nIt didn't do much for the first few minutes but after I let myself go and relaxed a bit, it actually gave me a Boner and I thought \"wow, this actually works\". (spoiler, it didn't)\n\nSo I watched the full Video (12min) but I didn't finish. I was close a few times though.  \nAnd since I was so close to finishing, I wanted it to work so badly that I replayed the Video and tried it again.  \nAnd again.. and again.. and again...  \nAnd after trying over and over again it stopped giving me a Boner, but I was so into it I just wanted to finish. So I opened up another Video and just used my hands to finally finish.\n\nWhen finished, I realized 1h30 had passed. I had my eyes closed for 1h30 just listening to this HFO-Porn trying to cum. \n\nAfter finishing I immediately felt like I had smoked 30 joints, did 2 workouts and hit my head 3 times with a brick. It feels like everything good has been sucked out of my soul and I just want to cry and lay down, but I can't.\n\nIdk if this gets seen by anyone, but if so - fucking don't do that shit.

I was a Soldier who had just picked up stripes and became a Sergeant. I used to be a lean mean fighting machine that was physically and mentally tough, ready to bring death to the enemy of my country, both foreign and domestic. I had just came back from a deployment and went through the woes many male Soldiers that deploy go through, to include missing the birth of my first daughter, but I was proud of my military career, so proud in fact that I chose to reenlist.\n\nWith the exemption of my last duty station, I was constantly stationed in Infantry Units. The unit that I was in conducted weekly road marches of a monitor 12 miles that included a 70+ lbs load plus what we call Full Battle Rattle. FBR refers to all the combat gear we wear. You can only imagine the toll this takes on your back. We conducted these road marches for a period of about 4 years.\n\nI regularly get massages to aid the buildup of tension in my back. This is where the FU happened. My regular therapist was booked and I booked a massage at a place I was unfamiliar with and did no research towards. I arrive at the place and as I arrive in the room, I started to feel that was read looked \"different\" meaning that it didn't seem \"professional\". But I figured I might as well stay since I am already there and the pain was killing me. I proceeded to let my guard down and without going into too many details, I was SA'd by a small, older female masseuse because I relaxed a little too much.\n\nThe consequences of this assault immediately affected my career. The PTSD that came from this assault caused me to change who I was into who I currently am. I no longer want to go out. I constantly avoid people. My marriage has taken a toll. I have 5 young kids and I still have troubles with sharing close proximity with them. I currently make myself as disgusting and unappealing as possible; not showering for weeks, gaining weight, keeping myself ungroomed, etc.\n\nRegardless of how much therapy I go through, I still believe this was my fault because I walked in there being physically fit with pain that is inherent to being a Soldier. Regardless of how nice people are or appear to be, I cannot trust anyone. My leadership, the people that I would directly lay down my life for, did not believe that I was assaulted because I am male, I somehow could have stopped the small female masseuse, and because of how fit and how much of a good Soldier I was. \n\nTLDR: IFU by having back pain, getting a massage which led to me being SA'd"},{"title":"TIFU by not taking constipation seriously","ups":70,"selftext":"Obligatory not today, but a few years ago, before the pandemic. Also, throwaway account because I like my main account and don't want this skid mark in my post history.\n\nI (35 F) don't poop a lot. It's usually not an issue but most weeks I only end up needing to poop 2 or 3 times. Other times it's a non-stop poop circus. I eat pretty normally and healthy, almost exclusively home cooked food. Of course, some of this is because of diet but also my digestive system is just not the best. All to say, I don't need advice on what to eat / how to be a better pooper.\n\nA while back I changed my diet pretty dramatically to what I described above and that major change had some digestive repercussions. Namely, I pooped even less. This resulted in what I can safely name the worst poop of my life, and this has been a life pretty full of gut wrenching poops.\n\nOne morning before work I felt things brewing. I knew I hadn't gone in a while and I was in for a bad time so I brought my phone with me and planned on scrolling Instagram while I completed the Great Work. Fate, however, had other plans for me. It wasn't long before I realized, this poop just... wasn't... working. I've literally never experienced this before or since. We've all had big, difficult poops in our lives. Maybe you've even split your butthole a little on a really large job. I'm telling you this was different. I knew that thing was not coming out naturally. \n\nI honestly had no idea what to do. I briefly imagined having to go to a hospital to get this poop removed from my body. My abdomen was aching terribly now. I started googling (in an incognito tab) what the fuck you do when you have a log so large your body can't expel it, and google, of course, took me to reddit. Most of the stories I read said yeah you can go to a doctor, but they are just going to stick what amounts to a poop shovel in your butt and hook the poo out a little at a time. I did not want to live through an event like that. Many redditors suggested you could perform a similar procedure on yourself with a gloved finger. I was shivering now. I emailed work and told them I wouldn't be in today. \n\nI didn't have gloves in the house. Why would I have latex gloves in the house? Reader, I could not fathom putting my finger up my butt hole into a wall of poop unsheathed. I had just barely accepted that manual intervention was needed, I wasn't about to go in naked.\n\nThere was only one thing to do. My body started shuddering. I needed to go to the drug store and buy gloves. I wiped. There was no need. Not even enough poop to stain a piece of toilet paper had escaped my body yet. I stood up and pulled my pants up. And I was still pooping. My body simply could not stop pooping. After trying for twenty minutes, my body had just gone into auto pilot. It had to choose between fight or flight and it chose both. All of the mechanisms of pooping were still in operation. Every ten seconds or so my sphincter would involuntarily push as hard as it could, trying to take this goddamn cursed shit. \n\nThere was nothing I could do. I just had to go shopping while actively trying to shit. If you're thinking I'm going to get to the store and poop my pants, you haven't been paying attention. I'm telling you, this shit was going nowhere. At the very least, I had zero fear I'd poop in the store. I had been on the toilet for about 30 minutes at this point and I knew my enemy by then. \n\nA cold sweat broke out over my body. I drove the 5 minutes down the street to the blessedly close drug store. I walked in knowing I was still just taking a shit while people bought tampons and cough syrup all around me. It was 8am on a weekday and I was shitting in Shoppers Drug Mart. I had no fucking idea where they kept gloves because why would I? It took me a while to find them and all the while painful contractions wracked my body in waves every few seconds. I really can't describe the feeling of my body trying to push this poop out without my consent and without any hope of success. You know how a good poop feels satisfying? This poop was the evil mirror version of that feeling —constricting, painful, horrifying. \n\nI found the gloves. I had to buy a box of 100. I did not care. I would have bought 1000 gloves if I had to. I checked out. I have to believe that the woman who checked me out didn't know I was shitting during the entire transaction. When I got home I returned to my original position to finish what my body started. I donned the glove and within minutes I had cleared enough of the roadblock to unleash a highway of shit. I may have cried a little, holding my gloved hand aloft.\n\nI now keep stool softeners in the house at all times. When the pandemic hit shortly after, I had 99 gloves available to me. \n\nTL;DR I got so constipated and grew such a huge turd that I couldn't poop it out naturally and ended up stuck actively shitting at the drug store so I could buy gloves to use in manually removing the poo."},{"title":"TIFU by thinking my aunt had a special Italian pet name for me","ups":64,"selftext":"So this has actually been going on for the last 15 years, but I only figured it out today. My aunt has been living in Italy for most of her life and, obviously, speaks fluent Italian. Even when speaking in a different language, she'll sprinkle some Italian words in there. Whenever I went to visit her I was there with my family and we'd speak amongst ourselves, the only other person I remember hearing my aunt to was my uncle and her close friends. \n\n\nOn the the fuck up: occasionally when talking to someone she'd say \"senti\". Me, being 12 at the time, thought it meant something like \"love\", \"sweetheart\", etc. Whenever we'd talk and she'd say \"senti, this and that thing, blah blah\" I'd feel loved and special because she was using this pet name reserved for her closest friends. \n\n\nI've decided to learn Italian a couple of weeks ago because I want to be at least trilingual. I'm on week  2 of intense studying using an app, and I remembered that the way I learned English and Spanish as a kid was watching tv. So I loaded up some Italian shows with English subtitles and off I went on my learning journey. It didn't take long for someone to say \"senti\", and I, now aged 27, thought \"oh it's the special nickname my aunt has for me!!\" And then I looked at the subtitles. Again and again, every time they said \"senti\", they were just saying \"listen\". Like how you'd say \"look\" or \"so\" (albeit grammatically incorrect) to get someone's attention in English at the beginning of a sentence. 🥲\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I thought my aunt had a special nickname to show how much she loves me, turns out she was just trying to get my attention/announce the beginning of a sentence."},{"title":"TIFU by vomiting into a 92 year-old woman's vagina.","ups":38242,"selftext":"I had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center.

And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \"Georgia\" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \"Georgia, we're here to change you. \"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nManager said: \"I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \"That's nice.\" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said:  \"That's nice.\"\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \"If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.\"\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I'm still working there.

I'm not really into pee, so honestly thank god. This did though spark me to go on an internet deep dive into urine therapy, for which I am both wiser and deeply disturbed.\n\nWhen I went for my second x-ray for my ribs (they wanted to make sure it healed properly) I asked about my stinky feet, again. The consensus among all the doctors I have asked is that I just sweat through my feet. They're just stinky. It's a permanent curse and I have come to accept it, as has my girlfriend (with much chagrin).\n\nYes, my girlfriend and I are still together, she did not leave me over my feet like some of you suggested she should. She was wonderful during the healing process and spoon fed me homemade tomato soup like a big man baby. It was nice. That could be something I'm into now if it means free soup? Who knows.\n\nAll in all, things are good. Thank you to everyone who was concerned for my health-- foot and injury related. This may not be as exciting of an update as people were hoping for, but despite my dramatic retelling of the original story, my life is not actually that dramatic.\n\n\\--\n\nTL;DR: My ribs are healed but my feet still smell.

I get to this huge roundabout leading to a dual carriageway and notice a warning light. Now I’m still pretty new to driving so have very little experience with which warning lights mean what, this one had a temperature symbol with some squiggly lines under it which I figured meant low engine coolant. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that it actually means “the engine is overheating, pull tf over right now”. So I kept driving for about 5 minutes and made it within minutes of home. Around this point the accelerator pretty much becomes non-functional and the car starts slowing down. As I pull over to the hard shoulder, steam starts coming out of the bonnet and I rush to get out and over the barrier.\n\nIn the end I was waiting about 4 hours to be towed to a garage, waiting as the sun set and it got cold.

I still wanted to post:\n\nYou need a little backstory for this one:\n\nAt the time I still lived with my parents and we were in the process of moving. Our previous house had been sold for a while (15 months) and while we were waiting on our new house being built, my brother and I shared the guest room in our grandma’s home and my parents shared a room in my sister’s home.\n\nYou should know the guest room is a VERY small room. It barely fits 2 single beds and a small closet. Note that I had been sharing this room with my brother ever since my parents sold the old house. I was not on best terms with my brother so when Corona happened and all my physical classes were cancelled, I stayed at my GF’s student dorm room until this particular day. \n\nMy mom left her car with me at my grandma’s so I could drive and meet my parents the next day. We were finally going to get the keys to our new home after 15 months of waiting. It got delayed for almost 12 months.\n\nWhen I arrived the day before, my brother had placed the two single beds together for the time I was gone. Since it was already late we kept the beds like this and went to sleep. Or at least I tried. I suffer from hay fever and it was especially bad this night. My nose was stuffed and I had to keep blowing my nose, not to mention it was one of the hottest nights of the year and my brother doesn’t want the door or window opened for some reason.\n\nMy brother kept sighing at me after continually blowing my nose, so I decided to try and sleep on the couch in the living room, where it was a lot less hot. My hay fever let me down and I slept for about 2 hours. I was supposed to meet my parents early and had to get up at 6 am.\n\nMy mom had asked me to wear old clothes and shoes the day before, since we had to paint the walls in our new home. I put on some old shoes with a small hole in the sole, I thought nothing of it at the time.\n\nMy mom’s car is a manual. The car we had at my GF’s place which I had been driving in for the last few months was an automatic.\n\nSo... I was exhausted in the morning and a little anxious since I hadn’t driven stick in a while. It is about a 20 minute drive to meet up my parents and everything went smoothly, until I had to brake in the parking spot in front of my sister’s home. The gas pedal somehow got stuck in my shoe at the last moment. I panicked and tried to find the brakes with my left foot but it was already to late. I could only reach the clutch pedal and drove the car right into my sister’s wall and it made huge cracks.\n\nThe car was surprisingly fine. Hardly even a scratch, the wall however was ruined.\nLuckily it wasn’t a retaining wall, but it does need to get replaced for the most part.\n\nTL;DR My gas pedal got stuck in a hole in my shoes when trying to park in front of my sister’s home, causing me to drive in the wall.\n\nDon’t drive with holes in your shoe?"},{"title":"TIFu by not properly backing up my files","ups":3,"selftext":"To understand my pain, You first have to know that I achieve EVERYTHING, from dumb notes to backups of my old Windows partition and ISOs for many different operating systems.

I did this by copying all my folders over to another HDD and then copy them back on the new Raid 5 (I know this is unsafe). Sadly I didn't just copy everything at once but small bits over a longer period of time so I can still use the Raid 5 for the time. This was, as I now know, very dumb, as I forgot to copy my Blender(3D modelling program) files, because I didn't check correctly if I forgot anything. I just now realized this when I wanted to test compression methods with my videos I created in Blender. Just to clarify this: I lost around a year of work and probably more than 50 projects.\n\nI'm now sitting at my PC screaming and crying in my mind, as I can't believe how much I lost and how dumb I was.

My boyfriend then, quite embarrassedly, admits that he got a couple weird looks while shopping. The first being when a worker came up to him at the store (it was a little drug store) and asked if he needed anything, looked at the two items he was holding, made a face at him, and just walked away.

Oral treatment wasn’t an option so we had to dart 5 mls of long-acting antibiotics in a big dart (big heavy dart with big needle). The tiger was unfortunately 15-20 meters away in its enclosure, so it was already a bit of a tricky shot. To make matters worse, there were 2 students and staff around looking over my shoulders.
