Sister with her E.L.A. homework.  I’m on the opposite side of the table from her, unless she needs my as[sis]tance, (see what I did there)?  My mind is deep into the post, and she quietly asked for help a few times.  I didn’t hear her, but next thing I know she’s right beside me reading the post from over my shoulder while I am.  She sees the post title, but still continues reading, (she’s 10, of course lol).  When I finish reading the post and ask her what she needed help with, that’s when I notice her next to me.\n\nOut of instinct and adrenaline, I threw my phone on the ground.  She asks, “What app is that on?” \n\nLuckily, she will not be telling our dad unless she wants him to find out that she has a dry ramen noodle pack stashed in her room.\n\nTL;DR\n\nUnless it’s r/eyebleach, do not scroll through Reddit posts while you’re helping your sibling with homework."},{"title":"TIFU by vomiting into a 92 year-old woman's vagina.","ups":32149,"selftext":"I had just begun a new job working in memory care at a senior center. I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training.... I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.\n\nThe first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.\n\nMy manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \"Georgia\" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \"Georgia, we're here to change you. \"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nManager said: \"I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \"That's nice.\" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said:  \"That's nice.\"\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \"If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.\"\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I'm still working there. I've not vomited into any more vaginas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr:  If you're sick, stay home."},{"title":"TIFU by going though my girlfriend’s phone.","ups":3109,"selftext":"This happened about 3 hours ago 3:30 am for me. My girlfriend had been acting a little suspicious. She went out for dinner and drinks on Friday and was out until 3:00 am, which is a little weird. Then I found out that it was really just her and a guy friend of hers and that guy friend lied to mutual friends about where he was. I talked to her about it and she told me that it was supposed to be other people, but they bailed.\n\nI’ve been struggling with depression and some anxiety, and just started a new med last week, so I assumed I was paranoid because of that. I trust her after all. However, I woke up at 3:00 this morning with a pit in my stomach. She took her phone into the shower with her last night. She never does that. More paranoia, I tried to tell myself. You love her, I said to myself, you trust her. It’s a violation of her privacy, I warned myself. After about 30 minutes I decided that I wasn’t going to sleep until I convinced myself that nothing was going on, soI took her phone off the nightstand.\n\nIt was all there. My very worst nightmare. I scrolled back as far as I could stomach. Nudes, dirty talk, talking about the night before and even plans to get an Airbnb for next time. I screenshot it all and text it to myself, just in case she tries to deny it. I’m devastated. \n\nI don’t know what to do now. I love her. She is everything to me. She’s my constant companion, my greatest comfort, my lighthouse in a storm. Whenever I’m upset I just want a hug from her. Not now. I don’t want to tell any of my friends, we’ve been together so long that all of my friends are her friends as well. I don’t want them to think less of her or be angry with her, as stupid as that may be. I still want to protect her from all of that because I love her. I can’t even be angry with her right now. Maybe that will come later.\n\nI also know that a lot of this is my fault. I haven’t been the partner she deserves. I’ve waited so long to seek help for my own mental health issues and that has been grossly unfair to her. Not doing chores when I’m home all day because I feel depressed, for example. \n\nI want us to get through this, but I don’t know how. I just keep thinking about those messages. It makes me feel sick ever time I do. I wish I could forget.\n\nThanks for allowing my venting/therapy post. I feel a little better for the moment. Also, please don’t be mean to her in the comments, that will not help me at all here, just make it worse.\n\nTLDR: Looked the my girlfriend’s phone and found proof that she’s cheating.

To be honest, I was surprised that it started on my first try. I actually enjoy mowing the lawn, so I popped my earbuds in and I was blissfully cutting the grass to the tunes of REO Speedwagon.\n\nAbout 15 minutes in, I was cutting the strip past my sidewalk but before the street. As homeowners, we’re responsible for this section in Kentucky, even though it’s right on the edge of the road. \n\nI got about halfway through this strip when the mower died. Makes sense. It was outta gas. I ran to the garage to grab my jerry can of gas and left the mower where it died. It took me a minute of fumbling through my messy garage before I found the can. Who cares? I was hopping along to my music.\n\nI came back out and the lawn mower was gone. No sign of any cars or people nearby.

Around 2 in the afternoon, I decided to paint my toenails and went to the bathroom to get the polish.\n \nWhile I do normally wear casual comfy clothes around the house, that day I hadn't even changed out of my pajamas. In fact, I'd borrowed a pair of my husband's big, baggy fleece pants. They're huge. Perfect for cozy pj's. \n\nUnfortunately, on my way down the hall, my left foot caught in the excess material of the right pant leg. I wasn't able to stop my forward momentum midstride and continued forward with my toe wrapped in the excess material of the pants. \n\nY'all. I actually *stepped on* my toe. It was completely pulled beneath my foot, breaking the bone clean in half and partially amputatating it from the nail up. I basically almost ripped it off. When my husband found me on the floor, the fabric of the pants was still INSIDE my foot and he had to *pull it out of me*. (Italics alone cannot convey the horrified shudder that ran down my spine as I typed that sentence.)\n\nHere's the SFW x-ray [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/ry2LWrc). The top joint of my big toe isn't a joint at all; that's the break. \n\nI got stitches to reattach my toe and have to wear a boot for 6 weeks. All because I decided to paint my toes while wearing too-baggy borrowed pants.\n\nHonestly, I think the fact that they were fleece pajama bottoms just adds insult to injury. They're the least threatening of all the pants. It's ludicrous\n\nI get the stitches out on the 23rd.

After immobilisation we did a full work up, X-rays and blood work. Later the bloodwork showed a mild infection so treatment with antibiotics was indicated. Oral treatment wasn’t an option so we had to dart 5 mls of long-acting antibiotics in a big dart (big heavy dart with big needle). The tiger was unfortunately 15-20 meters away in its enclosure, so it was already a bit of a tricky shot. To make matters worse, there were 2 students and staff around looking over my shoulders.

Fast forward a couple days, and my boyfriend (21M) and I had both come down with a cold, nothing major, but we were both pretty sick. At this point, we are a couple days into our cold, and the only symptoms we have left are essentially a mild cough, and a slightly runny nose - so my boyfriend decides to go back to work.\n\n I was still staying home, and, innocently enough asked him to grab me some tissues on the way home from work, since we were running low. The day goes on, and I start doing my normal tattoo care, when I notice I'm running low on lotion. Then I remembered my boyfriend is already going to the store - perfect! I text him \"hey, can you grab me lotion for my tattoo as well please?\" thinking nothing of it. \n\nHe gets home from work later in the day, and sets the items I asked for on the bedside table - and then I notice the conspicuous relationship between the items, and make a little joke about it. My boyfriend then, quite embarrassedly, admits that he got a couple weird looks while shopping. The first being when a worker came up to him at the store (it was a little drug store) and asked if he needed anything, looked at the two items he was holding, made a face at him, and just walked away. And then later when he was leaving the store, dropped the lotion, and a nice older woman picked it up to hand back to him, saw the tissues in his hand, and chuckled before walking away. \n\nTL;DR I asked my 21 year old boyfriend to grab me tissues from the store, and then later asked him to grab lotion as well - without realizing the implication.

So it's like 3-4 cm down there when flaccid so I'm pretty insecure about it.\n\nTwo days ago I was hanging out with my buddy and his 3 friends from where he lives. I haven't met them because I live away. We played cards and talked for a bit. While we were talking one of his friends (I'll call her Ana) asked everyone what's the weirdest place they had sex, I didn't want to seem like a loser (I know it's dumb) so I tried to think of something believable but couldn't think of anything, so they understood I was a virgin after a couple seconds of silence. Ada said \"No way YOU haven't ever had sex” and my buddy came to my rescue and told her to leave it alone so she didn't push me further.\n\nAna was quite lovely and I was getting kind of attracted to her. We all talked a bit more and watched a movie. She was sitting next to me and the seats were lined up in kind of like a \\ _ / shape, we were sitting in the middle one. It was getting a little late and she must have been getting sleepy so she slowly snuggle-leaned on me. I am ashamed but I couldn't keep myself from imagining having sex with her so I got a boner. I was hoping she wouldn't notice but I think she giggled because of it. \n\nWhen the movie ended, the other two went home. Little later I said that I'll go home too, then Ada asked if I could walk with to her place, I said sure. We arrived, exchanged numbers and I walked to a bus stop thinking I'll never talk to her again because of my shy, insecure ass. \n\nWhile I was waiting the bus, she called me and told me she took my keys by accident, I checked them and said ok. I got excited to be able to see her again. Walked to her apartment, ringed the bell and she told me to come up. She opened the door, and she was wearing kind of a boy's shorts pajama and a baggy tshirt with no bras. I couldn't believe that this was real, but she told me to come in. I totally forgot why I got there so walked in. She gave me the keys and asked me if I wanted tea. I was really sure where this was going so I got really nervous, even thought of running out in that moment. She came with teas, we talked a little bit then she asked me \"Is this a weird place to have sex?\" I just got fucking frozen but no action down there. She took off her shirt. I was begging to get hard and don't know why I couldn't. She came closer, looked into my eyes, grabbed my pants and took them off. I had all the time in the world to stop her then but I didn't know if I wanted to. When she saw my flaccid, 3 centimeters weiner she froze for a couple of seconds too. I got so embarrassed that I just pulled my pants up and ran out, letting out a small \"sorry\". She said \"wait!\" behind me but I couldn't look behind and ran to the bus stop. We didn't call each other and I didn't tell anyone about this.\n\nTL;DR: Ran away during sex because I am insecure about my penis size\n\nEDIT: Thanks y'all very much for the advices, you actually made me feel better. I think I'll call her tomorrow (It's 2.30 am here) because I'm afraid to make her feel insecure or like it's her fault. I won't specifically talk about the incident but will ask her on a date. I hope all goes well!\n\nEDIT 2: WOW! Thanks everyone. I was really not sure but felt like calling would be more sincere than texting so I called. I felt my tummy turn when I hit the call button, but it was definitely worth it. I told her that I am so sorry for the other night, and it was definitely not her fault. I said that it was just because I really liked her so got nervous, and I didn't want to fuck up a possible friendship/relationship so my head just wasn't there when I fled like that. She said that it's totally ok and she felt like going that fast wasn't the best thing for her to do either. We decided to give it another shot so we're going on a date tomorrow! No planned sex though, we both feel it should happen more naturally.

From the beginning of the talk my friend, sitting next to me, is rallying up all of his mates to join him in a condom demonstration if it comes, trying to get one of his friends to deal with the shaft as he deals with the rubber. As the talk processes and the possibilities of a condom demonstration become more likely, I knew who the man for the job was. \n\nThe science of the condom was soon explained to us; did you know if you say you can't fit into a condom you're a liar? Finally, the sex ed instructors pulled out of a bag of condoms and with it a blue, 3D printed \"demonstration device\"; the size of which being quite empowering to most of the men in the room. The lady pushed the latex free contraceptive to one side of the packet before making a careful tear and placing the special balloon on the phallic object.

After taking it off, I put it over my hand and showed off the elastic properties at the request of a girl sitting in the front row. \n\nDespite the positive uproar received, the condom is constantly being brought up by everyone, including strangers.

Well, so I did usually what anyone with good butt would do, I started to suggest her what worked for me, and how I was able to achieve a big butt. I told her that my glute muscles are so developed that once I inserted my palm a bit between my ass cheeks and squeezed my glutes, and the process significantly caused discomfort to my palm. I went ahead telling her that I personally believe XYZ influencer has a great butt and he uses the same program that I use, and although we are guys, she could use the same program as a girl.

A few of my friends know my Reddit account and I don't need them overreacting about my asthma attack.\n\nThis morning I was at the beach, enjoying the pleasant weather while eating my sandwich and people-watching. I happened to notice a couple using sign language to communicate with each other. Back when I was still dating my now ex gf who was born Deaf, I made it my mission to learn sign language. So when I noticed the couple using sign language, it made me smile because that was me and my gf once. I was about to look the other way because I didn't wanna eavesdrop. But then I caught the guy telling the girl: \n\n*\"Poop during anal I can handle. It's the texture of the poop that might be my dealbreaker. I will keep fucking if I feel solid turds up your ass, but if your shit is runny and leaking all over my dick, hell no\"* \n\nI snorted so hard while laughing I coughed on my sandwich, which triggered my asthma. Due to my own carelessness, I had to fucking run to my car to retrieve my inhaler because I decided not to put it in my pocket where it belonged. Running made it worse. I underestimated how far I parked. By the time I got to the car, I was wheezing to the point of almost passing out. Thankfully I was able to get my hands on my inhaler in time. It was intense. I spent about 10 - 15 minutes just sitting in the car, catching my breath. Almost choked to death because I laughed at random people talking about poop. \n\nTL:DR Watched a couple on the beach using sign language to communicate. I understood them. They were discussing poop. It made me laugh, which triggered my asthma and almost made me lose my life."},{"title":"TIFU by putting the hotel room sign the opposite way","ups":24321,"selftext":"So after a month without sexual activity with my girlfriend (just for context she is from another country and went to spend a full month with family) when she got back we decided to spend a romantic weekend at an hotel.\n\nWe travelled around 2 hours by car, we had lunch and we went for the check in. Everything was fast and smooth and we order a bottle of wine to the room. \n\nAs I had seen the cleaning ladies down the hall i decided to put the sign saying \"Do not Disturb\".\n\nAfter one glass my girlfriend starts the long due sexual intercourse which I am not going to get into too much detail cause that's not the point of the story. \n\nWhen we were in the perfect point in the middle, where the noises are louder and you are not long from the climax we heard some noises and then we see a cleaning lady in our room that had seen us. \n\nShe apologizes and leave very quickly but she had caught us right in the moment. After finishing the business I walk out and notice my Fucked Up. I had put the sign the opposite way which said \"Please Clean this Room\". Ashamed i tell my girlfriend that and we go to have a shower. \n\n5 minutes later the hotel manager appears, knocks and offer us a free wine bottle and some apples on the house. This was very nice and we thanked but totally not needed cause the Fuck Up was ours and not theirs. Still pretty nice. \n\nTL;DR : I put the hotel sign that said clean the room instead of do not disturb and was caught having sex by the cleaning lady.

Or so I thought.\n\nHere I am, in the spare room playing some games when I hear my fiance in the living room face timing her Dad. I shuffle through my SERVD deck and decide it's time to strike: The Exchange Student Card - You must speak in an accent of my choice for 30minutes. \n\nI slap the card down next to her. French. She looks at me sheepishly but accepts. Explaining to her Dad in the worst accent conceivable, she tells him about the game and they have a giggle. He says he will call her back later.\n\nShe hangs up and looks at me. In what I can only describe as a Russian/German/French hybrid of an accent says, \"OP, my Dad called to tell me his Mum is dead.\"\n\nCue the shitty realisation that her Dad thinks I'm more of a moron than usual.\n\nTL;DR: made my fiance speak in a bad French accent when her Dad phoned to say her Grandmother had just died."},{"title":"TIFU not paying close enough attention to hotel sites after the pandemic...","ups":6,"selftext":"TLDR: Double check addresses prior to booking hotel rooms...\n\nHad plans with hubs to attend a fairgrounds motorcycle event in Spokane WA.

Found rooms in Spokane Valley WA for $69, figured OK, Motel 6ish but cool cause hey, booking thru the Kaley Couco site. My FU was not double checking the MAP...hotel looked like it was north of I-90 so OK, should be decent. Printed off the res prior and left after work, which was later in the evening. Rolling into town, I double check the address...OMG, I have booked a room on E Sprague. Now I lived in this town for a bit several years back, east Sprague is NOT known for decent hotels but hubs is all \"Nah, it didn't look too bad\" on the booking site...\n\nWe roll in late, about 11 but again, we're prepaid right?! Office is locked, scary guard guy cops a 'tude \"what do you want?!\"...Um, to check in?! We're looking at cars in the lot thinking, uh oh...

We are escorted to our room by nice guy, all the while he's apologizing as he opens the door with the master key override machine! So what, now we are trapped and unable to leave the room cause hmmm, no keys?! We survey the room, meh, no needles or other obvious ick so fine...let's hope the car alarm is good and we can grab some sleep. I grab the remote, sit gingerly on the bed and...TV has been shattered!! \n\nI was DONE. I swear I'm not that snob (we are Harley riders that ride/camp at Sturgis for Pete's sake!) but I do value basics and oh, safety?! We told nice guy we were outta there!! Call #1 to booking site: \"50% off next stay\"...um NOPE. Go by hotel next day (after going to FIVE others to even find an available room at midnight, sadly saved by Rodeway Inn lol), mgr agrees to refund, courteously apologizes. Call #2, \"we'll call ya back in an hour\". Four hours later and call #3, full refund. I swear I played the politest Karen on EARTH but damn...PLEASE, double check any travel \"deals\"...absolute nightmare!!\n\nOh, and there's another event I'm going to there in April, \"thank goodness we've got the AirBnB already booked\".

She tried to make small talk, and so did I, but we both wanted to get the Hell outta dodge. She did a good job, but I will not be going back. \nI did tip her pretty well though.

The sink/mirror area is in its own place, and the bathroom is just a toilet and shower. It’s kind of like the room we don’t talk about. \n\nWell recently, we decided to start cleaning it biweekly. I offered to go first because my roommate sucks at cleaning. \n\nIt was DIRTY. Lots of dust and other nasty shit everywhere. I cleaned up everything pretty good, however, there were areas on the toilet I couldn’t reach with paper towels and lots of stains in the shower and toilet that wouldn’t come off. \n\nI remember my 2 toothbrushes, and decided to use the extra one as a scrub to clean the bathroom.

I’m the type of cook that likes to do everything from scratch, so by extension I get all the ingredients to make the curry paste. \n\n\nThe first step is crushing together some salt, lemongrass, and green chillies in a mortar and pestle. Now I have a high spice tolerance and work with spicy stuff a lot, so when I prepared the peppers by cutting them and taking out the core with all the seeds I didn’t wear gloves. Then I started grinding together the first of my ingredients and all seemed to be going well until 5 minutes later.\n\n\nI started to feel a slight burning sensation on my fingertips and knew that it was the peppers, but it was mild so I ignored it thinking it would pass in a minute or so. The burning got more intense to the point where it was distracting but I wanted to try to ignore it even still. \n\n\nA few minutes later and I was in a good deal of pain and was trying to soak my fingers in milk to quell the burning. A lot of things I tried felt good initially but didn’t provide any lasting relief and the pain kept ramping up. My fingers felt like Satan shat on them after eating Chipotle and I was kinda panicking.\n\n\nAn hour and a half later the pain felt similar to the time I had a third degree burn. I was desperate to get the capsaicin out and even tried sandpapering the skin off (didn’t work).\n\n\nI tried everything I was able to find online: baking soda/corn starch solution, isopropyl alcohol, dish soap, vinegar (this made it worse), bug bite/poison ivy cream, even lidocaine cream. Nothing was working and DIY amputation with no anaesthetic seemed almost preferable to having my hands blowtorched. The hospital wasn’t an option since I’d rather not incur a bill for $5000. Temporary relief was felt when my hands were in the milk or cold water but it was hard going even 30 seconds without it. In total the excruciating pain alone lasted 6 hours.\n\nTL;DR: handled chili peppers, hands burning resulted in some of the worst pain of my life"}]
